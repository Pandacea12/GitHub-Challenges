## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have spent more time than I should wondering why the border radius on top of the QR picture was different from the bottom one, until I finally realized that it was an issue with the padding setting.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on learning flexbox and flex grid in the future, seeing as those two are my weakest areas when it comes to web page styling.

## Acknowledgments

Frontend Mentor provided very clear instructions that kept me from struggling too much.
