## Overview

### The challenge

There was an incident when reorganizing the files, but the hover effect on the button should work fine. I havent been able to find a way to make it transition smoothly due to it being a gradient.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Extension

### What I learned

It was probably ambitious for a second project to apply Sass for the first time as well as shifting the files to a more centralized web page and I ran into several issues with the Sass Watch on VSCode which ultimately led to me deleting the scss sheet for this project after completing it. ( The issue I ran into was that this project's CSS ended up beign copied and applied to the webpage itself).

For Sass, I leaned about the use of variables, the @use rule and the use of partials to keep my master sheet clean.

I also learned that the opacity setting in CSS applies to the child elements and cannot be overwritten, so it's simpler to create new variables hsla instead of trying of trying to create multiple divs and clog the html.

I learned more about Flexbox too, as well as its interactions with the sass notation (Although I gave up for the titles and cheated using absolute positioning to get them on the same level).

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to get used to working with sass for multiple projects and hopefully avoid a repeat of this project's many incidents.


### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - It was useful to remind myself of how it worked, considering it was the core of this project.
- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - A useful reminder of how the notation worked.
